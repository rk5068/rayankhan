            <p>Tibet is an extremely large country, larger than France, Germany and Poland combined! It is situated high up in the Himalayan plateau. Tibet is also the spiritual capital of Vajrayana Buddhism. the country is under the soverignty of China since it was conquered in the 1960's. the Dalai Lama the spiritual and political leader of Tibet has set up his "government in Exile" in Northern India where many Tibetans live as refugees today. Many still consider Tibet a historical province of China and while I was there I was discouraged from taking too many photos.</p>
